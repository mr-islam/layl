## Development & Programming

**‚ö†! Major updates in progress, see the latest updated branch !‚ö†**

I work on this as a hobby during my freetime, so my full effort & focus goes to actual updates that benefit *users* and thorough bug-testing. Thus documentation and the issues board on GitHub are not updated regularly.
 
Please contact me if some code is unclear, or if you would like to contribute so I can share development plans. I would be more than happy to update the project plans or code documentation as soon as there are people interested in contributing‚Äîuntil then, I'm full-focus on actual improvements üëç. 

### Scripts 

Run for development with `npm start`, build with `npm run build`. 

*This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).*
